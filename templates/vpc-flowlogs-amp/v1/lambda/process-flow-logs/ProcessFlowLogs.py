"""Aggregates VPC Flow Log records into Prometheus series and writes them to an
Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace.

Sibling of ProcessCUR: same repository, same conventions -- configuration from
environment variables with built-in defaults, wired resources arriving through the
names the generator exports, plain print() for logging, and a handler that accepts
either an S3 event or an explicit key.

WHAT THIS SLICE DOES, AND WHAT IT LEAVES OUT. It reads plain-text flow log objects,
derives the field map from each file's own header, keeps only the egress direction,
names both ends, collapses everything outside the known CIDRs, accumulates into
60-second buckets and writes the result once. It does NOT yet write partials, run a
compactor, or read Parquet -- those come after the first run proves the path.

NO NEW DEPENDENCIES. Remote write is protobuf framed in snappy, and neither needs a
package here: the WriteRequest message is small enough to encode by hand, and the
snappy format permits an all-literal block, so a valid payload can be produced without
compressing anything. Signing uses botocore, which the runtime already carries.

    WHY A SAMPLE IS NOT WRITTEN AT THE BUCKET'S OWN INSTANT. AWS splits one

    each object is a separate invocation holding only its part of that minute.
    Both writing at the bucket instant means two different values at the same
    instant on the same series, which Prometheus refuses -- and it refuses the
    whole request, so the other series go with it. Measured on 2026-09-22, ten
    minutes into the first run and with a single network interface: bucket
    1790117040 arrived as 2778 bytes in one object and 1401 in another.

    Offset inside the minute, the two become samples of the same series at
    DIFFERENT instants, which is legal, and `sum_over_time` over the window adds
    them back to 4179. That costs nothing on the read side: the series is sparse,
    so the query was already a range query summing the window, never an instant
    query.

    IT COMES FROM THE KEYS AND NOT FROM THE CLOCK, so a retry of the same objects
    writes the same instant with the same value -- and a repeated sample whose
    value matches is accepted, which makes the retry free instead of fatal.

    `hash()` cannot be used: Python randomises it per process, so the same object
    would land on a different instant after every cold start, and the retry would
    stop being idempotent.

    WHAT IT DOES NOT FIX: the top-N cut still runs per invocation, so a pair kept
    in one object and cut in another leaves the minute undercounted, silently.
    Only a writer that sees the whole minute fixes that one.
